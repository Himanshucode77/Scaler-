'''Descriction : Write a program to check if a postal code is a valid postal code or not. A valid code has to fulfill the below requirements:
1. must be a six-digit number.
2. must not contain more than one alternating repetitive digit pair.
Alternating repetitive digits are digits that repeat immediately after the next digit. In other words,
an alternating repetitive digit pair is formed by two equal digits that have just a single digit between them.'''
